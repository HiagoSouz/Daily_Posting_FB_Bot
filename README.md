# Creating a daily posting bot for Facebook

## Getting your token

Firstly, it's necessary to get an access token for automatic posts. You can use any site you prefer (or even develop your own).
I recommend this site: https://maxbots.ddns.net/token/

Follow the steps and then save your token.

## Import the packages

We will use the packages 'Facebook' and 'Schedule' in this project. Import them using 'pip install Facebook-SDK' and 'pip install schedule'

## Function generateMessage()

This bot will daily post a synonym for the word "Yes" on your page. Of course you can modify the content and adapt. All you need to do is modify the content of the 'message' variable.

## Inserting the Token

In the line 19 you need to insert your token number. 

## Setting the posting interval

Now, in the line 24 you need to set you posting interval. Use hours or minutes and it's ready.

## Success

Now your bot is working. :)
